        <p>I assume that I will be using this webpage for
            Lab 1 in my CS260 course. For now, it is mostly
            blank, but please enjoy this photo of some bread
            that I made. In case you also want to make bread
            like this, I've also included a link to the book
            that taught me the recipe: <a href='https://kensartisan.com/flour-water-salt-yeast'>Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>.
